## Admins @ DevRel Collective

As many of us know, like most things we do as DevRel professionals, running this group takes a community of people. If you’re interested in being a part of that community, we’d love to have you on board! Here are the expectations that we have for the “Benevolent Dictators” (our tongue-in-cheek name for admins):

* Be consistently present at the once-a-month meetings. Exceptions will obviously be made for travel and personal engagements, but the understanding is that these meetings will be a priority to all admins.
* Be available and willing to contribute a few hours each month to various projects to move the group forward. NOTE: technical skills are not required! These projects will require writing, design, and coding skills alike, and we intend to have a variety of skills represented throughout the admin group to ensure that we can meet these needs.
* Be able to take the initiative to move projects forward without prompting. We have open issues on Github as well as a #help-needed channel in the group. You are expected to pick up an open ticket and make progress on it at some point throughout each month. Progress reports on these projects will be one of several topics addressed at the monthly meetings.
* Be an active member of the DevRel Collective Slack group. Offer feedback in channels, actively moderate discussions to ensure compliance to our Code of Conduct, and engage in mentoring our new members as well as keeping an eye on the #moderators channel should any issues arise.
* Be an active part of the Benevolent Dictators channel. Offer feedback on new applicants, participate in discussions about upcoming projects, and don’t hesitate to speak up if there are issues that need to be addressed.
* Your commitment is for a 3-month stint. At the end of those three months, you have the option to re-commit and stick around for another three months, or take your leave. No hard feelings either way! We have a 3-month rotation specifically because we know that some months are more difficult than others to be actively involved in the group.

Sounds a little too intense for your liking? No worries at all! Join the #help-needed channel in Slack instead or take a look at the issues on Github to see how you can help out.

Questions? Feel free to reach out directly to Mary Thengvall (@mary_grace) on Slack.

Best,
Mary, for all of the Benevolent Dictators
