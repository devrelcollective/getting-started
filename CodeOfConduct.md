# Scope
We expect all members of the DevRel Collective community, including administrators, users, facilitators, and vendors to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all DevRel Collective community venues, online and in person, all public and private channels, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to DevRel Collective affairs.

This policy covers the usage of the DevRel Collective Slack community, as well as the DevRel Collective website, and any DevRel Collective-related events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of DevRel Collective.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the DevRel Collective administrators.

# Friendly, Harassment-Free Space
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and acknowledge that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is never a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users of DevRel Collective is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing package names, nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Any member of a hate organization, or supporter of such, is not welcome.

Everything shared in the DevRel Collective is under FrieNDA. 
### FrieNDA
> All opinions, concerns, feelings, rants, and viewpoints, whether about people, events, companies, or the tech industry, shared in this Slack shouldn't be shared without the explicit (and enthusiastic) consent of the person who shared it. This includes sharing information without attributing it to the specific person who said it (e.g. "I heard in a Slack team I'm a part of that... "). In short, if the information is public knowledge (i.e. can be cited by a readily available online source), it's fine to share, but if you're quoting an individual's opinion, you must receive their permission first.


# Acceptable Content
The DevRel Collective administrators reserve the right to make judgement calls about what is and isn't appropriate in published content. These are guidelines to help you be successful in our community.

Content must contain something applicable to the previously stated goals of the DevRel Collective community. "Spamming", that is, publishing any form of content that is not applicable, is not allowed.

Content must not contain illegal or infringing content. You should only publish content to DevRel Collective if you have the right to do so. This includes complying with all software license agreements or other intellectual property restrictions. For example, redistributing an MIT-licensed module with the copyright notice removed, would not be allowed. You will be responsible for any violation of laws or othersâ€™ intellectual property rights.

Content must not be malware. For example, content (code, video, pictures, words, etc.) which is designed to maliciously exploit or damage computer systems, is not allowed.

Content name, description, and other visible metadata must not include abusive, inappropriate, or harassing content.

# No Solicitation
We all work for great companies (or have our own consultancies), and 'evangelizing' our products and services is part of what we do. But this is meant as a space to learn good practices from each other, talk about our careers, our wins, struggles, etc. It's not meant to be a place to solicit new business.

To that end, direct, unsolicited pitching of a business, product, or service to other members, whether it be in a channel or Direct Message (DM) is not allowed.

# Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct
If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of Conduct, please contact any of the admins listed at the top of this document and send us an abuse report. If this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

# Consequences
All content published to DevRel Collective, including user account credentials, is hosted at the sole discretion of the DevRel Collective administrators.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, employees, customers, or others with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the DevRel Collective administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service).

# Addressing Grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, please notify the DevRel Collective admin team either by posting in #moderators or reaching out privately via DM to any of the admins listed at the top of this document.

We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

# Contact Info
Please contact any of the admins listed at the top of this document if you need to report a problem or address a grievance related to an abuse report.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.
